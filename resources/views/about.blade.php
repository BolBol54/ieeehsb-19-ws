                    <p>The Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, IEEE, was found in 1884; it is a
                        non-profit organization that aims for technological innovation.</p>
                    <p>There are more than 430,000 IEEE members in more than 160 countries. The IEEE publishes a third
                        of the world’s technical literature in electrical engineering, computer science and electronics
                        and is a leading developer of international standards that underpin many of today's
                        telecommunications, information technology and power generation products and services.</p>
                    <p>Obviously, the organization couldn’t cover the whole world without dividing it through regions;
                        the organization made 10 regions, region 8 covers Europe, Middle East, and Africa.</p>
